# Agentic SpectrumDetect Application

A **FastAPI** based chat application that uses a configurable LLM (via OpenAI‑compatible API) and a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) toolset to provide an interactive, AI‑driven spectrum analysis assistant.

The repository contains two ways to run the application:

* **CLI mode** – a terminal based chat interface.
* **Server mode** – a FastAPI web server exposing a simple chat UI and a JSON streaming API.

Both modes share the same core logic implemented in `agent/src/agent/agent.py` and `agent/src/agent/server.py`.

- **Web UI** – minimal HTML/JS front‑end served by FastAPI.
- **Streaming responses** – newline‑delimited JSON for incremental updates.
- **Configurable via environment variables** – all settings are defined in `agent/src/agent/settings.py`.
